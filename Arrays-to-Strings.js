// In JavaScript, when you use the `+` operator with arrays, it doesn't perform array concatenation or addition. 
// Instead, it implicitly converts the arrays into strings and then concatenates those strings.

let a = [1];
let b = [2];
console.log(a + b); // Output: "1,2"

// Explanation:
// - When `a + b` is executed, JavaScript converts both arrays `a` and `b` into strings.
// - The array `a` becomes `"1"`, and the array `b` becomes `"2"`, so the result is the string `"1,2"`.
