// In this example, an array `x` is defined, and the `delete` operator is used to remove the element at index 1 of the array.
// The `delete` operator removes the element but does not modify the array's length or shift the other elements.

let x = [1, 2, 3];
delete x[1];  // Deletes the element at index 1, but does not adjust the array's length
console.log(x.length); // Output: 3

// Explanation:
// - The `delete` operator removes the value at the specified index, but it does not change the array's length.
// - After `delete x[1]`, the array becomes `[1, empty, 3]`, where `empty` indicates an empty slot in the array.
// - The `length` of the array remains 3 because `delete` does not shrink the array. It simply marks the index as "empty" but keeps the array's length intact.
